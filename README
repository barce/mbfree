WHAT IT MEANS
-------------
  Rumors of what mbfree means.
  Mega Byte Free
  Memory Be Free
  
WHAT IT DOES  
------------
  Mbfree allocates and frees a given amount of memory.  It is especially
  helpful on systems that are over utilized that swap a lot.

WHY MBFREE
----------
  A lot of OSs loose performance when their main memory is used and 
  the OS is swapping.  Mbfree allows you to allocate a certain amount
  of memory and free it.  In Linux the result is usually faster loading
  of programs -- or successful loading of programs when they don't
  load because there is not enough free memory.

USES OF MBFREE (SERVER USES)
----------------------------
  My websites are served from wilcox.nirvani.net.  It is a PII 400 with
  128MB of RAM.  I also use this machine as a workstation sometimes.  
  During the day is is hammered pretty good.  I have mbfree run every 120
  seconds freeing up anywhere between 20 and 40 MB of memory.

  Apache+php+mysql used to lock up every now and again.  I always suspected
  that it wasn't apache+php+mysql that was causing apache to freeze, but
  that it was the OS being way over utilized.  

  Now that I run mbfree on a schedule, I haven't had it do it.

  
OTHER USES (DESKTOP USES)
-------------------------
  Ever have Netscape Navigator lock up?  (me too).

  Try killall -9 netscape, then run "mbfree 40".  Try starting it up again.
  There should be enough unallocated memory that Netscape will be happier.
  Use at your own risk -- it works for me.

  Ever have RealNetwork's RealPlayer in linux just freeze -- or maybe 
  it doesn't start up and it is real jerky?  (me too).

  Try shutting down realplayer, run "mbfree 40" and fire up realplayer again. 
  It works for me.  Like Navigator, Realplayer is really picky about not 
  having enough memory.
